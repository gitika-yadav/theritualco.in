            <details open>
                <summary>What weights are available?</summary>
                <div class="answer">
                    We’re launching with <strong>1&nbsp;kg</strong> and <strong>2&nbsp;kg</strong> options designed for intentional, form-first training.
                    <a href="/webpages/products/capsule-dumbbell">See full specs</a>.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What is the grip size?</summary>
                <div class="answer">Approx. <strong>35&nbsp;mm</strong> grip diameter—comfortable for most hand sizes.</div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What are they made of?</summary>
                <div class="answer">A cast-iron core wrapped in a soft-touch, skin-safe silicone outer coating.</div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Are these beginner-friendly?</summary>
                <div class="answer">
                    Yes—especially for home training. The 1–2&nbsp;kg range helps you master form, build joint strength, and avoid overloading early on.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Are silicone dumbbells safe for floors?</summary>
                <div class="answer">
                    The capsule shape and silicone coating are gentler on floors than bare metal. For delicate surfaces, we recommend using a mat.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Do the dumbbells have any smell when new?</summary>
                <div class="answer">
                    A mild “new product” scent can occur initially and typically dissipates after a short airing. Wipe once with a damp cloth and let dry.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Are they latex-free and skin-safe?</summary>
                <div class="answer">
                    The outer is silicone. If you have material sensitivities, please review the specs and test cautiously; discontinue use if irritation occurs.
