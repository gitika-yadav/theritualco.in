        <h1>About The Ritual Co</h1>

        <p><strong>The Ritual Co</strong> was born from the idea that fitness should feel like a celebration — not a chore. We believe that movement, much like meditation or music, is a ritual. It’s personal. It’s powerful. And it deserves design that reflects that.</p>

        <p>Founded by <strong>Gitika Yadav</strong>, The Ritual Co blends softness and strength in every product — whether it’s our capsule-shaped dumbbells or our blush-toned mats. Built for women and wellness-forward minds, we want fitness gear to feel as good as it looks.</p>

        <p>With India’s first pastel fitness collection, we’re reimagining home workouts to be calm, aesthetic, and consistent. We prioritize:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Ergonomic design for comfort and control</li>
            <li> Pastel palettes that soothe and inspire</li>
            <li> Thoughtful packaging and conscious material sourcing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you're lifting dumbbells or lifting your mood, we’re here to remind you: <em>Movement is a ritual worth honoring daily.</em></p>
